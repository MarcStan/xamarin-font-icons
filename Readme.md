# Xamarin Font Icons

Demonstrate use of font icons in Xamarin Forms.

I originally used [icon-generator](https://github.com/MarcStan/icon-generator) to automatically create all scaled icons during build.

The main downside was that icons still had to be provided in light and dark theme. With font icons this is no longer an issue and additionally icons can be in svg format, allowing automatic scaling for in app icons.

This repository contains xamarin android/uwp projects that use a font as the icon source.
